Built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application. I chose to do a 'geek' theme. It's a full-stack site that takes in results from a survey and compares the answers to the saved profiles of other users. App will then display the name and picture of the best match based on the survey answers.

Used multiple Node modules, and **deployed to Heroku for the first time**. 

### Technologies Used
